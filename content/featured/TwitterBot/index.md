This project was intended to solve a synthetic code challenge by Google. The problem was as follows: Given a hypothetical fleet of drones, a list of customer orders and availability of the individual products in warehouses, schedule the drone operations so that the orders are completed as soon as possible.

I worked alongside a team of four to build a reliable and working simulation of the delivery operations that successfully managed the complexity of having multiple drones, customer orders, product types and weights, warehouses and delivery destinations.
