- Programmed several machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting on Python, achieving an R squared of ~85% and an average accuracy of ~93%.
- Subsequently wrote a white paper that described the feature in detail and advocated for the use of algorithmic grade predictors to be implemented across educational institutions worldwide.
